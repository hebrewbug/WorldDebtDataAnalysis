# World Debt Data Analysis
In this little resaerch I am showing the use of **SQL** for analyzing World Bank dataset. 
I took a pretty famous topic and used global debt statistics from actual [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/search?q=world+debt) information.
I used DataCamp studying project as an example to provide my own view on how it may works.

To see the resarch itself open a WorldDebtData.ipynb file.
